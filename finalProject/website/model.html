			<h2 class="title">Link to CVDLab PLASM models</h2>
			<p> The amount of details developed for this assignment - as you might have noticed from the picture in the <a href="gallery.html">Gallery</a> section - made it difficult (it requires a big amount of RAM and time), for the time being, to view the entire 3D model inside CVDLab PLASM altogether. In order to let you play with it and have a real feel of what it really was working with PLASM, I developed three independent submodels. </p>
            
            <ul>
            <li><a href="exterior/index.html">Exterior view</a>: you can view the exterior walls of the entire building, except for the columns.</li>
            <li><a href="interior/index.html">Interior view</a>: this time you can actually see the interior walls of the building. Fell free to walk around.</li>
            <li><a href="columns/index.html">Columns</a>: developing them was quite complex and PLASM seems to think it too, that's why I decided to develop a model of them apart from the rest of the building.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Please, be aware that it might take some time for the submodel you chose to load, so be patient and don't close your browser (Google Chrome is adviced). <br />
In case you might want to try to build the villa on your computer, you can find the code for the Villa <a href="https://github.com/cvdlab-cg/283890/tree/master/finalProject">here</a>. Then you can follow the instruction and start workin with PLASM yourself. A working Plasm alpha version can be found <a href="http://cvdlab.github.com/plasm.js/">here</a>.</p>
